# Coordinate Visualization and Image Overlay

## Overview

This project processes and visualizes a set of coordinates by creating a scatter plot, drawing lines connecting these points, and overlaying the result on an existing image. The final output is a composite image that shows the drawn lines overlaid on the original image.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `Pillow` (PIL)
- `matplotlib`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pillow matplotlib
